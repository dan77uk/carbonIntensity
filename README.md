[UK Carbon Intensity Live Site](https://dan77uk.github.io/carbonIntensity/)

As part of the Northcoders Software Development programme, this mini REACT app was developed over a two day solo sprint to demonstrate data visualisation using a third party API.

My app uses the Axios package to request JSON data from the carbon intensity API at [National Grid](https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/), which tracks the carbon intensity of the National Grid in real time, and can also display the current energy mix, both nationally and regionally.

The styling was approached from a mobile-first perspective, making use of the grid property to alter layouts across different screen sizes, and using the grid-area property to allocate screen real estate.
