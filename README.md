This REACT app was developed over a two day solo sprint, focussing on data visualisation using third part API's, as part of the Northcoders Software Development programme.

The app uses the Axios package to request JSON data from te API at [National Grid](https://)

The styling was approached from a mobie-first perspective, making use of the grid property to alter layouts on different screen sizes.
